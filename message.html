Pero like I said before you don’t know how lucky I am and your family to have met and have someone like you in our life. I don’t know if you noticed na you have a positive impact on me. Seeing you working hard and not failed to show up for your family made me want to do more and work hard in my life too. I’m not going to list everything now since this day is about you. I just want you to know that you are a blessing to me and to your family and we’re really happy to be able to celebrate your day with you.";

How I really wish I can remove all of your problems in life para you can finally prioritize yourself and relax. Yung di mo na iniistress iba and survival. You’re not loved by your family because on what you can do, but for you as a person. So please don’t forget about yourself and take care of your health.<br><br> I’m sorry for nagging sawa ka na ata marinig sakin yan HAHAHHA kaya I’m really frustrated na wala ko magawa.

I don't want to make any promises and want to be realistic as much as possible. Ayaw ko mag-promise na parang nangbobola lang ako but I can't stop myself from hoping deep inside. Na I want to have a future with you and build something with you, pero I really don’t know what should we do with our situation. What do you think should we do? When we both don’t have the capacity to be in a relationship right now. Still, I know na I want to be beside you no matter what and na I want to make us work.<br><br> Just know na kahit ano mangyare satin I'll always choose to support you.
